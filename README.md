# Multiplayer Pong Game Demo

## Introduction

This project demonstrates an online Pong game that allows players to compete against each other using a custom-built joystick controller and a web client. The game is powered by a CC3200 board and facilitated by a NodeJS server running on an AWS EC2 instance.

### Gameplay

### Joystick Sensor

The joystick module has two data pins, SW and VRx. The VRx pin outputs an analog signal ranging from 0-5v, which is converted to digital using the MCP3001 ADC. The joystick's position is then determined based on the converted signal.

#### Joystick Case

A 3D model for the joystick module was found and printed using a 3D printer. The case was then assembled with screws.

### Node Server

The NodeJS server running on an AWS EC2 instance manages the game state and passes gameplay data between the two players.

### WebSocket

The WebSocket protocol was chosen for its bi-directional communication capabilities and minimal header size. The WebSocket implementation for the CC3200 board supports string and close messages.

### Seeding Data between Players

Data is synchronized between the boards and the server during key gameplay events, such as when a player changes the direction of their paddle, blocks the ball, or misses the ball.

### Synchronization

To ensure smooth gameplay, each board assumes the opponent player blocks the ball unless it receives a payload that confirms this or a new round is started. Frame numbers are used to project the provided positional data back into the current frame.

### Cross-Platform Gameplay

A web client was created to connect to the same server, allowing players to compete against a CC3200 board.

### OLED Rendering

Rendering on the OLED is optimized by tracking the position or value of rendered objects and only re-rendering when those values change.

### Game States

The game progresses through various states, such as countdown, gameplay, and game over.
